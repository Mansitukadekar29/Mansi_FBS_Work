            <b><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kolhi" target="_blank">Virat Kolhi</a></i></b> is one of the most celebrated cricketers in the history of the sport, known for his fierce passion, unmatched consistency, and leadership. Born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, he rose through the ranks of Indian cricket after captaining the U‑19 team to a World Cup win in 2008. Kohli made his international debut the same year and quickly established himself as a modern-day great across all formats. He holds over 25,000 international runs and 80+ centuries, including 51 in ODIs—the most in history. As captain, he transformed the Indian Test team into a world-dominating side, emphasizing fitness, aggressive intent, and a strong pace attack. Under his leadership, India won their first Test series in Australia and maintained the No. 1 Test ranking for a record 42 months. In the IPL, he has been the face of Royal Challengers Bengaluru, finally guiding them to their maiden title in 2025. Kohli retired from Test cricket in May 2025, leaving behind a legacy of unmatched intensity and commitment. Off the field, he is a global sports icon, philanthropist, and entrepreneur, admired for his discipline, determination, and impact beyond cricket.
