    <b>INFORMATION RELATED MOON</b>
    <br>
    <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and the fifth largest moon in the solar system. Located approximately 384,400 kilometers away from Earth, it plays a vital role in stabilizing the planet's rotation and causing ocean tides through its gravitational pull. With a diameter of about 3,474 kilometers, the Moon has no atmosphere, which means it experiences extreme temperatures and cannot support life as we know it. Its surface is marked by craters, mountains, and vast dark plains called maria, formed by ancient volcanic activity. The Moon takes about 27.3 days to orbit Earth and the same time to rotate once on its axis, which is why the same side always faces Earth—a phenomenon known as synchronous rotation. Throughout history, the Moon has fascinated humans and influenced cultures, calendars, and mythologies. It was also the site of humanity’s first steps beyond Earth, with NASA’s Apollo 11 mission landing astronauts on its surface in 1969. Today, the Moon remains a key focus for space exploration, with future missions planned for research and potential habitation.</p>
